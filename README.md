Hello there! <3

This is the image gen source code for my Roblox game!
This only exists because this github repo runs the Roblox funcion to gen the image.



How does it work?
When you enter a image url and press mid, high, low, extra low, ect. It will send that info to railway, and then railway will download that image and run a .py file based on what button you pressed. (high, low, mid, ect) After that, it makes a lua script and sends it to Roblox. That lua script gets chopped and processed into a module script to generate your image into parts.

To upload custom images I recommend using:
https://postimages.org/
And copying the direct link.
However, you can use whatever you want to use, it just needs to be a direct link.
