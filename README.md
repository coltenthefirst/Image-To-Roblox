    <p>Roblox Image Generation from URLs</p>
</h3>

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the **Roblox Image Generator**. This tool allows users to convert image URLs into parts within Roblox, facilitating creative projects and gameplay. Users are free to use the files provided in this repository for their own purposes.

## How It Works
Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the process:
1. Input an image URL and select a quality setting (such as mid, high, low, extra low).
2. The image URL and selected quality are sent to **Vercel**.
3. Vercel downloads the image and runs a Python script based on your selection.
4. A Lua script is generated and sent back to Roblox, where it is processed into parts that resemble the pixels of your image.

## Uploading Custom Images
For uploading images, it's recommended to use [Postimages.org](https://postimages.org/) to obtain a direct link. Other services can be used as long as they provide a direct link.

## FAQ

**Q: Do my uploaded images get logged?**  
**A:** Uploaded images are saved in a temporary file called "tmp."

**Q: Will I get banned for using exploit images?**  
**A:** No, you will not be banned. The project generates parts based on your image, not Roblox assets.
